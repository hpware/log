## Future Roadmap
1. The text will be Markdown.
2. Adding image & video overlay view when users touch it.
3. Fixing the broken user page (maybe I'll work on it when I have time)
4. Remove Debug text.
5. Bring filtering to life. Including tags, and text (although the postgres index is a bit shotty). This will also include home, search and profile as well.
6. Videos should have a custom UI to it.
7. Short text previews on the home page instead of paragraphs of text taking over user's profile page, edit previews, search previews, and public feed previews.
8. Adding video encoding if possible.
9. Add more stuff that the administrator can just customize.
10. Collections, users can create collections of their trip for example. The home page and search would not include the collection searching.
11. URL Shortening. This software should have an auto url shorting thingy built right in (using /u/[slug]) or byo your own shlink server.
